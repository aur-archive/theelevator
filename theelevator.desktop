Comment=The story takes place in the fairly distant future and centers on a jaded, middle-aged detective named David Carmichael. Every morning, he rides a rickety old elevator up to his office near the top of a run-down building. For the last couple of months, he has met a young woman–Elena Cormack–every day in this elevator. Sometimes they talk, sometimes they spend the entire elevator ride in complete silence–but how will the relationship between these two people change?
